# bluetooth-RC-app
This is going to be an app that communicates with a bluetooth server from a computer. 
With python on the other end of this you can send pictures and recieve them and send basic messages.
I have noticed that Android Studio changes the formatting and libraries of it's code quite frequently,
so you will most likely need to change a few things.
Send the files java, res, and AndroidManifest.xml into the (App_Name)/app/src/main/ folder to replace your own.
